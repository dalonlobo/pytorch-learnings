- Tensors are similar to NumPyâ€™s ndarrays, with the addition being that Tensors can also be used on a GPU to accelerate computing.
- Any operation that mutates a tensor in-place is post-fixed with an _. For example: `x.copy_(y), x.t_(), will change x`
- The Torch Tensor and NumPy array will share their underlying memory locations, and changing one will change the other.
